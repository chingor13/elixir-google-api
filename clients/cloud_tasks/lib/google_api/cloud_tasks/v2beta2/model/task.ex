  ## Attributes

  - appEngineHttpRequest (AppEngineHttpRequest): App Engine HTTP request that is sent to the task&#39;s target. Can be set only if app_engine_http_target is set on the queue.  An App Engine task is a task that has AppEngineHttpRequest set. Defaults to: `null`.
  - createTime (DateTime.t): Output only. The time that the task was created.  &#x60;create_time&#x60; will be truncated to the nearest second. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Optionally caller-specified in CreateTask.  The task name.  The task name must have the following format: &#x60;projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID&#x60;  * &#x60;PROJECT_ID&#x60; can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]),    hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.).    For more information, see    [Identifying projects](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) * &#x60;LOCATION_ID&#x60; is the canonical ID for the task&#39;s location.    The list of available locations can be obtained by calling    ListLocations.    For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * &#x60;QUEUE_ID&#x60; can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or   hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters. * &#x60;TASK_ID&#x60; can contain only letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]),   hyphens (-), or underscores (_). The maximum length is 500 characters. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pullMessage (PullMessage): LeaseTasks to process the task. Can be set only if pull_target is set on the queue.  A pull task is a task that has PullMessage set. Defaults to: `null`.
  - scheduleTime (DateTime.t): The time when the task is scheduled to be attempted.  For App Engine queues, this is when the task will be attempted or retried.  For pull queues, this is the time when the task is available to be leased; if a task is currently leased, this is the time when the current lease expires, that is, the time that the task was leased plus the lease_duration.  &#x60;schedule_time&#x60; will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Defaults to: `null`.
  - status (TaskStatus): Output only. The task status. Defaults to: `null`.
  - view (String.t): Output only. The view specifies which subset of the Task has been returned. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [VIEW_UNSPECIFIED, BASIC, FULL]
