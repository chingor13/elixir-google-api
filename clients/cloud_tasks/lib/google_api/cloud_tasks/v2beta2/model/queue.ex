defmodule GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2beta2.Model.Queue do
  @moduledoc """
  A queue is a container of related tasks. Queues are configured to manage how those tasks are dispatched. Configurable properties include rate limits, retry options, target types, and others.

  ## Attributes

  - appEngineHttpTarget (AppEngineHttpTarget): App Engine HTTP target.  An App Engine queue is a queue that has an AppEngineHttpTarget. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Caller-specified and required in CreateQueue, after which it becomes output only.  The queue name.  The queue name must have the following format: &#x60;projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID&#x60;  * &#x60;PROJECT_ID&#x60; can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]),    hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.).    For more information, see    [Identifying projects](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) * &#x60;LOCATION_ID&#x60; is the canonical ID for the queue&#39;s location.    The list of available locations can be obtained by calling    ListLocations.    For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * &#x60;QUEUE_ID&#x60; can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or   hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pullTarget (PullTarget): Pull target.  A pull queue is a queue that has a PullTarget. Defaults to: `null`.
  - purgeTime (DateTime.t): Output only. The last time this queue was purged.  All tasks that were created before this time were purged.  A queue can be purged using PurgeQueue, the [App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud Console](/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/deleting-tasks-and-queues#purging_all_tasks_from_a_queue).  Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged. Defaults to: `null`.
  - rateLimits (RateLimits): Rate limits for task dispatches.  rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts however they control how tasks are attempted in different ways:  * rate_limits controls the total rate of   dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the   queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first   attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to   particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is,   retry_config controls task retries (the   second attempt, third attempt, etc). Defaults to: `null`.
  - retryConfig (RetryConfig): Settings that determine the retry behavior.  * For tasks created using Cloud Tasks: the queue-level retry settings   apply to all tasks in the queue that were created using Cloud Tasks.   Retry settings cannot be set on individual tasks. * For tasks created using the App Engine SDK: the queue-level retry   settings apply to all tasks in the queue which do not have retry settings   explicitly set on the task and were created by the App Engine SDK. See   [App Engine documentation](/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/retrying-tasks). Defaults to: `null`.
  - state (String.t): Output only. The state of the queue.  &#x60;state&#x60; can only be changed by called PauseQueue, ResumeQueue, or uploading [queue.yaml/xml](/appengine/docs/python/config/queueref). UpdateQueue cannot be used to change &#x60;state&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [STATE_UNSPECIFIED, RUNNING, PAUSED, DISABLED]
