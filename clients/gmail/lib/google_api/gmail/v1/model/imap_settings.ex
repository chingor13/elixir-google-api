  IMAP settings for an account.

  ## Attributes

  - autoExpunge (boolean()): If this value is true, Gmail will immediately expunge a message when it is marked as deleted in IMAP. Otherwise, Gmail will wait for an update from the client before expunging messages marked as deleted. Defaults to: `null`.
  - enabled (boolean()): Whether IMAP is enabled for the account. Defaults to: `null`.
  - expungeBehavior (String.t): The action that will be executed on a message when it is marked as deleted and expunged from the last visible IMAP folder. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [archive, deleteForever, expungeBehaviorUnspecified, trash]
  - maxFolderSize (integer()): An optional limit on the number of messages that an IMAP folder may contain. Legal values are 0, 1000, 2000, 5000 or 10000. A value of zero is interpreted to mean that there is no limit. Defaults to: `null`.
