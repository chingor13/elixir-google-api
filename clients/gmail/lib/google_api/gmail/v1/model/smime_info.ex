  An S/MIME email config.

  ## Attributes

  - encryptedKeyPassword (String.t): Encrypted key password, when key is encrypted. Defaults to: `null`.
  - expiration (String.t): When the certificate expires (in milliseconds since epoch). Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): The immutable ID for the SmimeInfo. Defaults to: `null`.
  - isDefault (boolean()): Whether this SmimeInfo is the default one for this user&#39;s send-as address. Defaults to: `null`.
  - issuerCn (String.t): The S/MIME certificate issuer&#39;s common name. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pem (String.t): PEM formatted X509 concatenated certificate string (standard base64 encoding). Format used for returning key, which includes public key as well as certificate chain (not private key). Defaults to: `null`.
  - pkcs12 (binary()): PKCS#12 format containing a single private/public key pair and certificate chain. This format is only accepted from client for creating a new SmimeInfo and is never returned, because the private key is not intended to be exported. PKCS#12 may be encrypted, in which case encryptedKeyPassword should be set appropriately. Defaults to: `null`.
