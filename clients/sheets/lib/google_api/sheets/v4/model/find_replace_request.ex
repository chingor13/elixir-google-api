defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.FindReplaceRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Finds and replaces data in cells over a range, sheet, or all sheets.

  ## Attributes

  - allSheets (boolean()): True to find/replace over all sheets. Defaults to: `null`.
  - find (String.t): The value to search. Defaults to: `null`.
  - includeFormulas (boolean()): True if the search should include cells with formulas. False to skip cells with formulas. Defaults to: `null`.
  - matchCase (boolean()): True if the search is case sensitive. Defaults to: `null`.
  - matchEntireCell (boolean()): True if the find value should match the entire cell. Defaults to: `null`.
  - range (GridRange): The range to find/replace over. Defaults to: `null`.
  - replacement (String.t): The value to use as the replacement. Defaults to: `null`.
  - searchByRegex (boolean()): True if the find value is a regex. The regular expression and replacement should follow Java regex rules at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html. The replacement string is allowed to refer to capturing groups. For example, if one cell has the contents &#x60;\&quot;Google Sheets\&quot;&#x60; and another has &#x60;\&quot;Google Docs\&quot;&#x60;, then searching for &#x60;\&quot;o.* (.*)\&quot;&#x60; with a replacement of &#x60;\&quot;$1 Rocks\&quot;&#x60; would change the contents of the cells to &#x60;\&quot;GSheets Rocks\&quot;&#x60; and &#x60;\&quot;GDocs Rocks\&quot;&#x60; respectively. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sheetId (integer()): The sheet to find/replace over. Defaults to: `null`.
