  The response when clearing a range of values in a spreadsheet.

  ## Attributes

  - clearedRanges ([String.t]): The ranges that were cleared, in A1 notation. (If the requests were for an unbounded range or a ranger larger  than the bounds of the sheet, this will be the actual ranges  that were cleared, bounded to the sheet&#39;s limits.) Defaults to: `null`.
  - spreadsheetId (String.t): The spreadsheet the updates were applied to. Defaults to: `null`.
