defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.HistogramRule do
  @moduledoc """
  Allows you to organize the numeric values in a source data column into buckets of a constant size. All values from HistogramRule.start to HistogramRule.end will be placed into groups of size HistogramRule.interval. In addition, all values below HistogramRule.start will be placed in one group, and all values above HistogramRule.end will be placed in another. Only HistogramRule.interval is required, though if HistogramRule.start and HistogramRule.end are both provided, HistogramRule.start must be less than HistogramRule.end. For example, a pivot table showing average purchase amount by age that has 50+ rows:      +-----+-------------------+     | Age | AVERAGE of Amount |     +-----+-------------------+     | 16  |            $27.13 |     | 17  |             $5.24 |     | 18  |            $20.15 |     ...     +-----+-------------------+ could be turned into a pivot table that looks like the one below by applying a histogram group rule with a HistogramRule.start of 25, an HistogramRule.interval of 20, and an HistogramRule.end of 65.      +-------------+-------------------+     | Grouped Age | AVERAGE of Amount |     +-------------+-------------------+     | &lt; 25        |            $19.34 |     | 25-45       |            $31.43 |     | 45-65       |            $35.87 |     | &gt; 65        |            $27.55 |     +-------------+-------------------+     | Grand Total |            $29.12 |     +-------------+-------------------+

  ## Attributes

  - end (float()): The maximum value at which items will be placed into buckets of constant size. Values above end will be lumped into a single bucket. This field is optional. Defaults to: `null`.
  - interval (float()): The size of the buckets that will be created. Must be positive. Defaults to: `null`.
  - start (float()): The minimum value at which items will be placed into buckets of constant size. Values below start will be lumped into a single bucket. This field is optional. Defaults to: `null`.
