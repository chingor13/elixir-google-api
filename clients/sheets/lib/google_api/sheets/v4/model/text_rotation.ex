defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.TextRotation do
  @moduledoc """
  The rotation applied to text in a cell.

  ## Attributes

  - angle (integer()): The angle between the standard orientation and the desired orientation. Measured in degrees. Valid values are between -90 and 90. Positive angles are angled upwards, negative are angled downwards.  Note: For LTR text direction positive angles are in the counterclockwise direction, whereas for RTL they are in the clockwise direction Defaults to: `null`.
  - vertical (boolean()): If true, text reads top to bottom, but the orientation of individual characters is unchanged. For example:      | V |     | e |     | r |     | t |     | i |     | c |     | a |     | l | Defaults to: `null`.
