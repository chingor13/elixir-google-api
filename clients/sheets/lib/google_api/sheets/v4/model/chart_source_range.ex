  @moduledoc """
  Source ranges for a chart.

  ## Attributes

  - sources ([GridRange]): The ranges of data for a series or domain. Exactly one dimension must have a length of 1, and all sources in the list must have the same dimension with length 1. The domain (if it exists) &amp; all series must have the same number of source ranges. If using more than one source range, then the source range at a given offset must be in order and contiguous across the domain and series.  For example, these are valid configurations:      domain sources: A1:A5     series1 sources: B1:B5     series2 sources: D6:D10      domain sources: A1:A5, C10:C12     series1 sources: B1:B5, D10:D12     series2 sources: C1:C5, E10:E12 Defaults to: `null`.
