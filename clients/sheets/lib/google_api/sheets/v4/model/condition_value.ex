  - relativeDate (String.t): A relative date (based on the current date). Valid only if the type is DATE_BEFORE, DATE_AFTER, DATE_ON_OR_BEFORE or DATE_ON_OR_AFTER.  Relative dates are not supported in data validation. They are supported only in conditional formatting and conditional filters. Defaults to: `null`.

  - userEnteredValue (String.t): A value the condition is based on. The value will be parsed as if the user typed into a cell. Formulas are supported (and must begin with an &#x60;&#x3D;&#x60; or a &#39;+&#39;). Defaults to: `null`.
