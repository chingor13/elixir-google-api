defmodule GoogleApi.Sheets.V4.Model.DimensionRange do
  @moduledoc """
  A range along a single dimension on a sheet. All indexes are zero-based. Indexes are half open: the start index is inclusive and the end index is exclusive. Missing indexes indicate the range is unbounded on that side.

  ## Attributes

  - dimension (String.t): The dimension of the span. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [DIMENSION_UNSPECIFIED, ROWS, COLUMNS]
  - endIndex (integer()): The end (exclusive) of the span, or not set if unbounded. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sheetId (integer()): The sheet this span is on. Defaults to: `null`.
  - startIndex (integer()): The start (inclusive) of the span, or not set if unbounded. Defaults to: `null`.
