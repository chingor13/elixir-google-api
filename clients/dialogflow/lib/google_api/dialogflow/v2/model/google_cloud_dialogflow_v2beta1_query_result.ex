defmodule GoogleApi.Dialogflow.V2.Model.GoogleCloudDialogflowV2beta1QueryResult do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents the result of conversational query or event processing.

  ## Attributes

  - parameters (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): The collection of extracted parameters. Defaults to: `null`.
  - action (String.t): The action name from the matched intent. Defaults to: `null`.
  - allRequiredParamsPresent (boolean()): This field is set to: - &#x60;false&#x60; if the matched intent has required parameters and not all of    the required parameter values have been collected. - &#x60;true&#x60; if all required parameter values have been collected, or if the    matched intent doesn&#39;t contain any required parameters. Defaults to: `null`.
  - diagnosticInfo (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): The free-form diagnostic info. For example, this field could contain webhook call latency. Defaults to: `null`.
  - fulfillmentMessages ([GoogleCloudDialogflowV2beta1IntentMessage]): The collection of rich messages to present to the user. Defaults to: `null`.
  - fulfillmentText (String.t): The text to be pronounced to the user or shown on the screen. Defaults to: `null`.
  - intent (GoogleCloudDialogflowV2beta1Intent): The intent that matched the conversational query. Some, not all fields are filled in this message, including but not limited to: &#x60;name&#x60;, &#x60;display_name&#x60; and &#x60;webhook_state&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - intentDetectionConfidence (float()): The intent detection confidence. Values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain). Defaults to: `null`.
  - languageCode (String.t): The language that was triggered during intent detection. See [Language Support](https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/language) for a list of the currently supported language codes. Defaults to: `null`.
  - outputContexts ([GoogleCloudDialogflowV2beta1Context]): The collection of output contexts. If applicable, &#x60;output_contexts.parameters&#x60; contains entries with name &#x60;&lt;parameter name&gt;.original&#x60; containing the original parameter values before the query. Defaults to: `null`.
  - queryText (String.t): The original conversational query text: - If natural language text was provided as input, &#x60;query_text&#x60; contains   a copy of the input. - If natural language speech audio was provided as input, &#x60;query_text&#x60;   contains the speech recognition result. If speech recognizer produced   multiple alternatives, a particular one is picked. - If an event was provided as input, &#x60;query_text&#x60; is not set. Defaults to: `null`.
  - speechRecognitionConfidence (float()): The Speech recognition confidence between 0.0 and 1.0. A higher number indicates an estimated greater likelihood that the recognized words are correct. The default of 0.0 is a sentinel value indicating that confidence was not set.  This field is not guaranteed to be accurate or set. In particular this field isn&#39;t set for StreamingDetectIntent since the streaming endpoint has separate confidence estimates per portion of the audio in StreamingRecognitionResult. Defaults to: `null`.
  - webhookPayload (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): If the query was fulfilled by a webhook call, this field is set to the value of the &#x60;payload&#x60; field returned in the webhook response. Defaults to: `null`.
  - webhookSource (String.t): If the query was fulfilled by a webhook call, this field is set to the value of the &#x60;source&#x60; field returned in the webhook response. Defaults to: `null`.
