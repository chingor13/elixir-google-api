defmodule GoogleApi.Composer.V1beta1.Model.NodeConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  The configuration information for the Kubernetes Engine nodes running the Apache Airflow software.

  ## Attributes

  - tags ([String.t]): Optional. The list of instance tags applied to all node VMs. Tags are used to identify valid sources or targets for network firewalls. Each tag within the list must comply with [RFC1035](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt). Cannot be updated. Defaults to: `null`.
  - diskSizeGb (integer()): Optional. The disk size in GB used for node VMs. Minimum size is 20GB. If unspecified, defaults to 100GB. Cannot be updated. Defaults to: `null`.
  - location (String.t): Optional. The Compute Engine [zone](/compute/docs/regions-zones) in which to deploy the VMs used to run the Apache Airflow software, specified as a [relative resource name](/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name). For example: \&quot;projects/{projectId}/zones/{zoneId}\&quot;.  This &#x60;location&#x60; must belong to the enclosing environment&#39;s project and location. If both this field and &#x60;nodeConfig.machineType&#x60; are specified, &#x60;nodeConfig.machineType&#x60; must belong to this &#x60;location&#x60;; if both are unspecified, the service will pick a zone in the Compute Engine region corresponding to the Cloud Composer location, and propagate that choice to both fields. If only one field (&#x60;location&#x60; or &#x60;nodeConfig.machineType&#x60;) is specified, the location information from the specified field will be propagated to the unspecified field. Defaults to: `null`.
  - machineType (String.t): Optional. The Compute Engine [machine type](/compute/docs/machine-types) used for cluster instances, specified as a [relative resource name](/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name). For example: \&quot;projects/{projectId}/zones/{zoneId}/machineTypes/{machineTypeId}\&quot;.  The &#x60;machineType&#x60; must belong to the enclosing environment&#39;s project and location. If both this field and &#x60;nodeConfig.location&#x60; are specified, this &#x60;machineType&#x60; must belong to the &#x60;nodeConfig.location&#x60;; if both are unspecified, the service will pick a zone in the Compute Engine region corresponding to the Cloud Composer location, and propagate that choice to both fields. If exactly one of this field and &#x60;nodeConfig.location&#x60; is specified, the location information from the specified field will be propagated to the unspecified field.  If this field is unspecified, the &#x60;machineTypeId&#x60; defaults to \&quot;n1-standard-1\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - network (String.t): Optional. The Compute Engine network to be used for machine communications, specified as a [relative resource name](/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name). For example: \&quot;projects/{projectId}/global/networks/{networkId}\&quot;.  [Shared VPC](/vpc/docs/shared-vpc) is not currently supported. The network must belong to the environment&#39;s project. If unspecified, the \&quot;default\&quot; network ID in the environment&#39;s project is used.  If a [Custom Subnet Network]((/vpc/docs/vpc#vpc_networks_and_subnets) is provided, &#x60;nodeConfig.subnetwork&#x60; must also be provided. Defaults to: `null`.
  - oauthScopes ([String.t]): Optional. The set of Google API scopes to be made available on all node VMs. If &#x60;oauth_scopes&#x60; is empty, defaults to [\&quot;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\&quot;]. Cannot be updated. Defaults to: `null`.
  - serviceAccount (String.t): Optional. The Google Cloud Platform Service Account to be used by the node VMs. If a service account is not specified, the \&quot;default\&quot; Compute Engine service account is used. Cannot be updated. Defaults to: `null`.
  - subnetwork (String.t): Optional. The Compute Engine subnetwork to be used for machine communications, specified as a [relative resource name](/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name). For example: \&quot;projects/{projectId}/regions/{regionId}/subnetworks/{subnetworkId}\&quot;  If a subnetwork is provided, &#x60;nodeConfig.network&#x60; must also be provided, and the subnetwork must belong to the enclosing environment&#39;s project and location. Defaults to: `null`.
