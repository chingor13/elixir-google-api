defmodule GoogleApi.DLP.V2.Model.GoogleTypeTimeOfDay do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a time of day. The date and time zone are either not significant
  or are specified elsewhere. An API may choose to allow leap seconds. Related
  types are google.type.Date and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`.

  ## Attributes

  - hours (integer()): Hours of day in 24 hour format. Should be from 0 to 23. An API may choose
  to allow the value "24:00:00" for scenarios like business closing time. Defaults to `nil`.
  - minutes (integer()): Minutes of hour of day. Must be from 0 to 59. Defaults to `nil`.
  - nanos (integer()): Fractions of seconds in nanoseconds. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999. Defaults to `nil`.
  - seconds (integer()): Seconds of minutes of the time. Must normally be from 0 to 59. An API may
  allow the value 60 if it allows leap-seconds. Defaults to `nil`.
